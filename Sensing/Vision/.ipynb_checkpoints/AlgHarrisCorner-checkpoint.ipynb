      "# Algorithm of Harris Corner Detector\n",
      "\n",
      "This file will show the implementation step-by-step of the **Harris Corner Detector** algorithm as presented by C. Harris and M.J. Stephens in 1988.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Harris Corner detector was proposed by Chris Harris and Mike Stephens in 1988 as a method to obtain the feature points of a grayscale image. Their idea is based on the [Moravec's Corner detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_detection#The_Moravec_corner_detection_algorithm \"Moravec's Corner Detector\"), which uses the change of intensity around the neighboring area of a pixel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wolfgang F\u00f6rstner initially proposed a [similar method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_detection#The_F.C3.B6rstner_corner_detector \"F\u00f6rstner Corner detector\") in 1986 based also on Moravec's corner detector, known as the F\u00f6rstner detector. He used the eigenvalues of this change of intensity (iso-responses), so that the corner detector could be insensitive to rotational and translational changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harris and Stephens, however, proposed a simplified version of it by using a simple function computing the same _**cornerness**_ of such Image gradients."
